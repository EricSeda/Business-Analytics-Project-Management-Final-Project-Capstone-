Project Objective: Build a price prediction model for single unit apartments in Manhattan to incorporate into APT212's Investment Projection Model

Project Tools:
The tools used to build this Data Warehouse were: 
1. For data integration - python, Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab
2. For data preprocessing and model fitting - Jupyter Notebook
3. For Business Presentation of Results - Powerpoint

### Project Planning

Motivation for project:
We partnered with APT212 to build a price prediction model for them to incorporate into their Investment projection model in an attempt to get more everyday people investing in New York Real Estate despite not having the experience or know how in the industry required to make investment decisions. 


Description of the issues or opportunities the project will address:
APT212 believes that the everyday person is underrepresented in the real estate investment market in Manhattan and seeks to extend this opportunity to those who may not have the time to do the necessary research or the background necessary to make confident deicions regarding investments in real estate. As it stood APT212 had an Excel Investment Projection model on their website that perspective investors can input real estate metrics into and return common investment metrics such as, ROI, IRR, etc., which they can use to to make investment decisions. The problem was that the user had to input their own sales price prediction which was driving away the very customer they aimed to target. Our project aims to make the model more user friendly.

Project Business or Organization Value:
By building an accurate price prediction model we can help make the investment projection model more user friendly by allowing the everyday investor who may not have the industry knowledge or time necessary to make confident investment decisions in the real estate market.
